SpotBot is Discord Bot which plays music from Youtube in the voice channel.

SpotBot is different from the other music bots, because it let the discord users log in to their own spotify account through the AGoodSpotifyAPI (uses Spotify's web api) written by me, so it could easily get access to the users liked songs on Spotify, convert it to a Youtube playlist, and play it inside Discord with a simple ".pl" (".playliked") command.

I have used this bot a lot while the quarantine, unfortunately I have not had the money and the time to make the bot available for the whole Discord community.
